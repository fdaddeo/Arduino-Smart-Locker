# Arduino Smart Locker

This repo contains the code for the realization of a smart locker.

The idea is that someone holding an authorized RFID card or a valid PIN can unlock the locker in order to put some stuff inside it.
Obviously, a closed locker can be opened only by whom have locked the locker before.

This smart locker is supported by a web application and a database, useful to handle the authorized users and to handle the reservation.

Note: the web application is not handled in this repo, maybe this will be a future work.

⚠️ This repo is under developing ⚠️
